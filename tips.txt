"As described above, it was decided that high resolution audio was a priority; therefore, the JACK server setting for sample rate was established at 44.1kHz and the bit resolution (-b) setting in JackTrip was set to 16 bit. Initially, it was determined that the number of channels for each node would be -n 2 (stereo transmission). However, after a long period of testing using the three aforementioned analysis tools, it was clear that some compromises had to be made, particularly in locations with lower quality service and less bandwidth. This included having to work with higher network latency in the system and lowering the number of audio channels to mono transmission.

The JACK server buffer size and JackTrip queue buffer length settings impact network latency and audio quality. After testing, it was determined that the JACK buffer
size setting would be set at 64 and the queue buffer length in JackTrip at -q 48. The redundancy setting was also crucial in diminishing the amount of glitches, particularly in locations with low-quality service but with sufficient bandwidth. After testing, it was determined that for the majority of locations, a redundancy value of –r 2 yielded the best results. This value, however, was not sufficient for the location with the lowest quality service. This connection exhibited a high number of glitches despite having sufficient bandwidth. As part of the assessment of audio quality, JackTrip’s zero underrun was tested. It was quickly established that the -z setting (zero underrun on) yielded the best results in all locations, diminishing the disruption of glitches and avoiding sustained artificial wavetable sounds."
